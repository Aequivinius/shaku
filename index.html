		<div class="collapsed" id="tea"><p>It is called the <em>tea</em> ceremony, but tea is just a vessel for hospitality. In a bowl, I taste three things: <span class="italic">the water, tea and the host's heart</span>. <span class="hand">But try drinking three bowls of tea on empty stomach: Tea is not always the best answer.</span> Thus I strive to bring the same care the tea ceremony fosters to everything I serve, be it tea, whisky or a glass of water.</p>

			<p>In saying that, in Japanese tea training, the <em>taste</em> of the tea is only an afterthought. However, the taste is a powerful channel of communication. <span class="hand">So, if it's tea I'm serving, the tea better be freaking delicios.</span></p>

			<p>Cheap <em>matcha</em>, especially, can be bitter and harsh; and there are vast <em>flavour</em> differences between teas. Not to consider them and find the most suitable flavour for the occasion is a shortcoming of the host. My school uses the teas of <em>Koyamaen</em>, and while I'm not shying away from others, I like most their <em>wako</em>, which I usually use for its full, but not cloying umami taste. See my <a href="http://tea.aequivinius.ch/wiki/matcha">tasting notes</a> of other teas.</p>

		<div class="collapsed" id="communication"><p>The Japanese tea ceremony doesn't start when the guest enters the room, but when the host sends an invitation on paper <span class="hand">(after the the date and all have already been settled upon)</span>.</p>
			
		<p>This is not just a mere formality, but an essential part of the congregation: It sets the <em>expectation</em>, which in turn acts as a basis for the gathering. The guest knows what they can expect, and thus can gauge the level of formality (and appropriate reimbursement). The host knows what the guests expect, and thus can play with their interaction.</p>
		
		<p>There is the story of <em>Hideyoshi</em>, who wanted to see <em class="dark">Rikyū</em>'s <em>morning glories</em> in the tea garden; but when he arrived, they all had been cut. Instead, when he entered the room, he found a single morning glory in the alcove. Imagine his amazement!</p>
		
		<p>This is not contrained to the tea ceremony, though, but is relevant in today's gastronomy as well. Asking a guest <span class="hand">what brings you here?</span> doesn't need to be an empty formality, but helps to establish what expectations they hold. This is particularly relevant when it comes to <em>money</em>. Nothing more souring than to find the whisky you enjoyed unbeknownst set you back a couple of hundred Franks.</p>

		<div class="collapsed" id="wagashi"><p>Just before you drink tea, you'll always be served a sweet. Against the backdrop of sweetness, the bitterness of the tea is all the more pleasant. It is the bitterness, not the sweetness, that is thus accentuated. Tea is <em>melancholy</em>, beauty seen through the veil of transience, or more plainly, sweetness in the light of bitterness.</p>
			
			<p>Traditionally, the sweets are made of sugared bean paste, which lends itself to be shaped into flowers or other seasonal items. More importantly, however, is the fact that it doesn't leave an oily residue on your hands or tongue that could sully your clothes or mask the taste of the tea.</p>
			
			<p>Because of that, translating <em>wagashi</em> culturally for Western palates is not an easy task, since most of our desserts contain fats in the forms of milk, chocolate or nuts.</p>

		<h1 class="hand">What is this about?</h1>
		<p>I am a bartender who turned to the Japanese and Chinese tea rituals to build a <em>theory of hospitality</em>. How to help the guest – be it in the tea house, in the bar or in our everyday life – attain a state of mind complete ease, where he or she does not need to think about his or her adequacy or what to do next, but instead can enjoy a moment in peace?</p>
		
		<div class="collapser" id="theory">
		<p class="centered collapsing"><a href="#theory">humility</a> and <a href="#theory">transience</a></p>
		
		<div class="collapsed"><p class="indent"><em>humility</em> in my comportment and as an aesthetic ideal. As a host, I try not to strive not to impress the guest. This is difficult, because at the same time I want to bring out the best tea, show the utmost consideration and use the finest silverware, metaphorically speaking. Yet all these should only serve to make the guest feel comfortable, not to show off my refinement, lest the guest feels inappropriate. So, for everything I do and for every thing I use, I ask: <span class="italic">does it help the guest to feel at ease, or is it just to impress him? Am I using it for the guest's sake or my own?</span></p>

		<p>Likewise, the tools we use and the architecture that surrounds the encounter should show <em>restraint</em> in their elegance, so that they underline the hospitality and do not distract from it with their beauty. If they draw too much attention, the guest's mind cannot come to rest. Instead, if the guest seeks to be entertained, only then should the refinement become apparent. While many Japanese arts express such an ideal, it is not confined to Japanese culture, and I am trying to find counterparts in Euorpean designs.</p>

		<p class="indent"><em>transience</em> as a guiding motif. Realising that every instant – a bowl of tea, a cocktail or a walk in the sun – is unique, and will never happen again in precisely the same way gives infinte value to it: Rare things are precious, so unique things are invaluable. This realisation is a reminder of the joy of being alife right now, and gives the guest a chance to focus completely on the here and now, temporarily sheltering him from the ghosts of yesterday and the woes of tomorrow. Simultaneously, it serves as a <span class="italic">memento mori</span>, and allows lightness of being that our mortality affords us put matters in a good perspective.</p>

		<p>However, all of us often fail to see things this way, and the host can help the guest to remember this; thus increasing the guest's enjoyment. In the decoration and matters of taste, the <em>seasons</em> and tasteful <em>signs of wear and use</em> are principal. Again, while many Japanese arts embody these principles, <span class="italic">vanitas</span> motifs are not uncommon in European culture, at all.</p></div></div>
